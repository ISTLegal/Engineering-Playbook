#### PR Etiquette

---

It is our belief that PR reviews should not negatively impact a team's ability to deliver features.
PRs that take too much time to get reviewed can hinder on a team's progress. As such, we practice the following behaviours when raising PRs:

- When I raise a PR, I specifically assign a developer and my TTL as reviewer
- When I raise a PR, I notify the reviewer(s) on Slack in a public channel
- The reviewer(s) can re-assign the PR to someone else (e.g. TTL re-assigning to a Senior Engineer)
- The reviewer(s) has a **8 hours SLA** to review the PR
- If SLA (Service-Level Agreement) is not met, I can merge the unreviewed PR if and only if:
  - All the PR checks are passing (CI, CodeClimate, Test Coverage)
  - I communicate in #technology Slack channel that I am merging an unreviewed PR
  - I immediately take ownership of fixing any issues that arise from merging the PR
