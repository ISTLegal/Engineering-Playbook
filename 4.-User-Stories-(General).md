#### Feature

---

A Feature story should contain the following information

**Title:** one line describing the story

**Description:** a detailed description of the story. The description should include acceptance criteria

Example

```
Title:
As a Director of Success (DoS), I should be able to initiate a "Share with Fellows" action for engagements with "Completed" needs assessments to Fellows who are not externally placed.

Description:
* As a DoS, I should be able to select and share engagements with "Completed" Needs Assessment status
* After sharing an engagement, it shows up in the open engagement view
```

**Note:** Every story title should include the word ‘should’ as opposed to ‘can’. e.g. It’s unclear whether the story “User can delete comment” is a feature or a bug. “User should be able to delete comment” or “User should not be able to delete comment” are much clearer: the former is a feature, the latter a bug.

#### Bug

A bug story should contain the following information:

**Title:** A short description of the bug.

**Description:** What is currently happening? What should be happening?

**Steps To Reproduce:** Outline the steps to reproduce/show the bug.

```

A chore story should include the following information:

**Title:** A short description of what needs to be done.

**Description:** Why is it needed? Does it help the team go faster or is it a dependency that could cause problems in the codebase if it’s not done?
