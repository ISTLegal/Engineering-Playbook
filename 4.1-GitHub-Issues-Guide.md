Creating rich and effective user stories as issues on GitHub is crucial for managing and tracking project requirements, tasks, and bugs. Here's a guide on how to craft well-structured user stories, focusing mainly on descriptions:

# 1. User Story Structure
User stories should follow the common format: `"As a [user role], I want to [action/feature] so that [benefit/value]."` This structure helps define the user's perspective, the desired functionality, and the motivation behind it.

Example: `"As a buyer, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart so that I can easily purchase multiple items at once."`

# 2. Story Description
A description provides a clear and detailed description of each user story. The description should expand on the user story title and include any additional context, requirements, edge cases, acceptance criteria, or the definition of done.

# User Story: Shopping Cart Management

## Description

As a buyer, vendor, or admin, I want to have a reliable and efficient shopping cart system so that customers can easily manage their purchases, vendors can track orders, and admins can monitor the overall shopping experience.

The shopping cart system should support the following operations:

- Create a new shopping cart for a user (authenticated or guest)
- Add items to the shopping cart
- Update item quantities in the shopping cart
- Remove items from the shopping cart
- Retrieve the current state of the shopping cart
- Persist the shopping cart data across user sessions

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Buyers can create a new shopping cart
- [ ] Buyers can add, update, and remove items from their shopping cart
- [ ] Buyers can retrieve the current state of their shopping cart
- [ ] Shopping cart data is stored in a persistent storage (e.g., database)
- [ ] Shopping carts are associated with user sessions or authenticated users
- [ ] Concurrent cart operations are handled with thread-safety and data consistency
- [ ] Appropriate error handling and validation are implemented for cart operations

## Developer Notes

- Design and implement the data model for the shopping cart (e.g., using a database or in-memory store)
- Define the API endpoints and request/response payloads for cart operations
- Integrate with the product catalog service to fetch product details and validate item availability
- Handle edge cases such as out-of-stock items, removed products, or pricing changes
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed cart data (optional)
- Ensure scalability and performance optimizations for high-traffic scenarios
- Implement logging and monitoring for cart operations

# Bug: Incorrect Total Price Calculation in Shopping Cart

## Description

As a buyer, when I add multiple items to my shopping cart and proceed to checkout, the total price displayed on the checkout page is incorrect. It seems to be miscalculating the total price, resulting in either an over or under-charged amount.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the e-commerce website
2. Browse and add at least three different products to the shopping cart
3. Proceed to the checkout page

**Expected Behavior:**
The total price displayed on the checkout page should be the sum of the prices of all items in the cart, including any applicable taxes or fees.

**Actual Behavior:**
The total price displayed on the checkout page is incorrect. For example, if the sum of the three items in the cart is $100, the total price shown might be $90 or $110.

- **Browser**: Google Chrome (Version 91.0.4472.114)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (Version 20H2)
- **Reproducibility**: This issue can be consistently reproduced.
- **Severity**: High (Incorrect pricing could lead to financial losses or customer dissatisfaction)

## Potential Causes

- Incorrect calculation logic in the shopping cart total price computation
- Inconsistent data formats or units (e.g., currency, decimal places) between the product catalog and shopping cart
- Missed edge cases or special scenarios (e.g., discounts, promotions, taxes, shipping fees)

## Suggested Steps

- Review the shopping cart total price calculation logic and identify potential issues
- Check for data consistency between the product catalog and shopping cart data structures
- Ensure that all relevant factors (discounts, taxes, fees) are correctly accounted for in the total price calculation
- Add unit tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases for total price calculation
