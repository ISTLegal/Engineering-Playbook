There's a lot we can do to encourage code reuse, sharing, and onboarding of new team members. For instance, Every GitHub repo should fill in the short description and website link at the top. Also, a GitHub repository needs a proper Readme to best help out our teammates.

The belief here is that a repo should have a few defining traits to make it easy for anyone to understand its purpose, set it up, run its tests, and work towards contributing to it.

Each Repo's readme should follow this basic structure:

```
## Repo Name [codeclimate badge] [testing badge]

1 sentence tagline

3-5 sentences describing the code and what its purpose is

## Documentation

List of endpoints exposed by the service
