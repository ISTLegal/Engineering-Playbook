A commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**, separated by a blank line.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than **100 characters!** This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub and in other various git tools.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

These rules are adopted from the [AngularJS commit convention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/).

#### Message Header

---

The message header is a single line that contains a succinct description of the change containing a **type**, an optional **scope**, and a **subject**.

#####`<type>`
This describes the kind of change that this commit is providing.

- feat (feature)
- fix (bug fix)
- docs (documentation)
- style (formatting, missing semi-colons, …)
- refactor
- test (when adding missing tests)
- chore (maintain)

#####`<scope>`
Scope can be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example **events**, **kafka**, **userModel**, **authorization**, **authentication**, **loginPage**, etc...

#####`<subject>`
This is a very short description of the change.

- use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Message Body

---

- just as in `subject` use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

#### Message Footer

---

Finished, fixed or delivered stories should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Finishes", "Fixes", or "Delivers" keywords like this:

```
[(Finishes|Fixes|Delivers) #STORY_ID]
```

#### Message Example

---

```

- ensure every event published to Kafka is delivered precisely once
- implement error handling for failed delivery

```
